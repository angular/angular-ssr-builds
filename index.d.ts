/**
 * Retrieves routes from the given Angular application.

 * This function initializes an Angular platform, bootstraps the application or module,

 * and function-based bootstrapping. It yields the resulting routes as `RouteResult` objects.
 *
 * @param bootstrap - A function that returns a promise resolving to an `ApplicationRef` or an Angular module to bootstrap.
 * @param document - The initial HTML document used for server-side rendering.
 * This document is necessary to render the application on the server.
 * @param url - The URL for server-side rendering. The URL is used to configure `ServerPlatformLocation`. This configuration is crucial
 * for ensuring that API requests for relative paths succeed, which is essential for accurate route extraction.
 * See:
 *  - https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d608b857c689d17a7ffa33bbb510301014d24a17/packages/platform-server/src/location.ts#L51
